                <h3>What do we do?</h3>
                <p>This is a valid question. Are we trainers? Mad scientists? Psychics? Maybe even time travlers? Well we are none of those. We are career medical professionals who choose to study how long a player may play based on similar past players. We use that data to give estimates of how long ones career might be. Inside the lab we store all those old players for future studies. Thats why you never see them anymore. We just let Allen Iverson out to play in the big-3. Arent we kind? </p>

                <h3>How we do it</h3>  
                <p>We typically take the athletes legs first..... just kidding. We are not crazy evil scientists like you would see in Hollywood. In reality we take measurements such as height, weight, vertical, all of the strength metrics as well as many others to gain these estimates. We believe these estimates are more than beneficial, especially to the organizations themselves. This also works both ways, but we are for the organiztions first because lets be honest, they have all the money.  </p>
